Finalize Project Scope: Decide on the absolute minimum features for your MVP. Don't add any "nice-to-have" features yet. For example, a simple command-line interface is perfectly acceptable.

The "Extravagant" MVP: Stock Price Analyzer
This project will be a command-line application that feels professional and feature-rich, without adding complex web development or machine learning.
Core Functionality (The "Doable" Part)
User Authentication:
User Registration: Allow a new user to sign up with a username. A simple password (not necessarily a hashed one for this deadline) is sufficient.
User Login: Authenticate a returning user. The application will remember the logged-in user for the session.

Stock Data Lookup:
Single Stock Lookup: Allow the user to input a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL). The application will retrieve and display the stock's most recent closing price.
Historical Lookup: Allow the user to input a specific past date. The application will fetch and display the closing price for that day.
Smart Caching: When a historical price is fetched from the API, it will be stored in your database. Subsequent requests for the same stock on the same date will retrieve the data from the database, reducing API calls and improving speed. This demonstrates excellent database design and efficiency.

Price Analysis:
Comparative Analysis: The user can compare a historical price to the current price. The application will calculate and display:
The absolute difference in price.
The percentage change.
Aesthetic Output: Instead of just printing numbers, the output will be formatted nicely. Use color-coded text (e.g., green for positive change, red for negative change) and clear labels.

Watchlist Management:
Add to Watchlist: Users can add a stock ticker to their personal watchlist.
View Watchlist: The application will display a list of all stocks the logged-in user is watching.
Quick Analysis: When viewing the watchlist, the application will not just show the tickers, but will also perform a quick check and display the current price and the day's percentage change for each stock. This is a very valuable and clean feature.

"Extravagant" Touches (The "Clean" Part)
Aesthetic Command-Line Interface (CLI):
Main Menu: The application will greet the user with a well-formatted menu of options.
Clear Prompts: Use clear, descriptive prompts for user input (e.g., "Enter stock ticker:" instead of just ":").
Formatted Output: All output will be presented in a clean, easy-to-read format with headers and proper spacing. Use a library like colorama for a simple and effective way to add color to your text.

Error Handling:
Polite Errors: Instead of crashing, the program will handle common errors gracefully. For example:
If a ticker is not found, print a message like "Ticker 'XYZ' not found. Please try again."
If the API call fails, inform the user about the issue.
If a date has no historical data, let the user know.

Structured Database Design:
Your database will have three clean, normalized tables: Users, Stocks, and Watchlist_Items (a join table). The structure will be logical and easy to understand. This demonstrates a strong grasp of the BCSE302L concepts.
By focusing on these features, you will have a project that is not only functional but also looks and feels professional. The "extravagant" part comes from the polished UI and thoughtful features like the quick watchlist analysis and smart caching, which show a deeper understanding of software design beyond just fulfilling the basic requirements.

Choose Technologies:

Database : *MYSQL*
API: Select a free, easy-to-use stock data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage).

Programming Language: Python is highly recommended due to its rich ecosystem of libraries.

Design the Database Schema:

Create a simple ER diagram for your Users, Stocks, and Watchlist (or a similar linking table).

Write the CREATE TABLE statements for these tables in SQL.

Days 4-7: Implementation - Part 1

Set up the Project: Create your project directory and set up a basic Python script.

API Integration:

Write a function to fetch the current stock price for a given ticker.

Write a function to fetch historical data for a specific date.

Test these functions independently to ensure they work correctly.

Database Connection:

Write the code to connect to your SQLite database.

Create the tables you designed in step 3.

User Management (Basic):

Create a function to register a new user (simple username/password, maybe not even a password hash for the MVP).

Create a function to "log in" a user (again, a simple check).

Watchlist Functionality:

Write a function to add a stock to a user's watchlist.

Write a function to display the stocks in a user's watchlist.

Week 2: Analysis, Interface, and Final Touches
Days 8-11: Implementation - Part 2

Historical Price Lookup and Storage:

When a user looks up a historical price for a stock, first check if you already have it in your database.

If not, fetch it from the API and store it in your database before displaying it. This will save API calls and make subsequent lookups faster.

Price Comparison Logic:

Write a function that takes a ticker and a historical date.

Inside this function, get the historical price (from the database) and the current price (from the API).

Calculate the absolute difference and the percentage change.

Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Create a simple menu-driven interface.

Options should include: "Login/Register", "Look up Stock Price", "View Watchlist", "Add Stock to Watchlist", "Analyze Price Change".

Tie all your backend functions to these menu options.

Days 12-14: Testing and Submission Preparation

Thorough Testing:

Go through all the menu options and test every piece of functionality.

Test edge cases, like an invalid stock ticker or a date far in the past.

Write the Project Report:

Document your database schema, design choices, and the technologies you used.

Explain how your project fulfills the requirements of the BCSE302L curriculum.

Include a user guide and sample output from your program.

Final Code Review:

Clean up your code, add comments, and ensure it's easy to read.

Prepare your final submission package.
